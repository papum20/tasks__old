# tasks__old
(quite messy) collection of solutions for a few tasks from many sources, mostly OII (Olimpiadi Italiane di Informatica - Italian Olympiad in Informatics), besides competitions and university classes

All solutions where developed using eclipse: that's why the whole repository is structured like workspace-folder/task-folder/src/task-name.cpp
